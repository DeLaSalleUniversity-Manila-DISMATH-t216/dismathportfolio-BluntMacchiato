#WEEK 1:
I was introduced to Discrete Mathematics and its significance in engineering and the current information society.
The Syllabus was explained
The logical puzzle of knights and knaves was presented to show an example of what is to come.

#Week 2:
Basic terms like proof, proposition, axioms, logical deduction, 

The types of truth:
*Legal truth

*Scientific truth 
*Probable truth 
*Philosophical Proof



I learned strange symbols, e.x., ¬ for Negation, ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction,⊕ for exclusive disjunction, → for implication, and ↔ for biconditional.

**~~Strange Symbols~~Logical Connectives**

|*¬* | Negation | not |
|*∧* | Conjunction | and |
|*¬* | Disjunction  | or |
|*¬* | Exclusive or  | xor |
